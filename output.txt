Let's xor vector and int*: 
Vector: capacity 5 --> 1 2 3 5 7 
int*: capacity 5 --> 2 3 5 7 8 
Result of xor vector and int*: capacity 5 --> 3 1 6 2 15 
Let's look at the empty vector: 
Empty vector: capacity 0 --> 
Let's look at not filled vector: 
Not filled vector: capacity 5 --> 0 0 0 0 0 
Let's copy the etalon vector: 
Etalon: capacity 5 --> 1 2 3 5 7 
Copied: capacity 5 --> 1 2 3 5 7 
Let's move the etalon vector:
Etalon: capacity 5 --> 0 0 0 0 0 
Moved: capacity 5 --> 1 2 3 5 7
